            <li><span class="bold">As a child,</span> I was always building something from scratch, whether they were automated toy cars or a computer. I was built and educated to be a doctor or an engineer. 
            
            <li><span class="bold">In college,</span> I fell in love with Journalism and Law. Enjoyed it, and it taught me different types of communication and storytelling.
                
            <li/><span class="bold">Graduating shortly,</span> I ended up  jumping into business, and learned the micro-and macro ins and outs of decision making from top to bottom. 
                
            <li/><span class="bold">Discovered three years into my business career,</span> the job of designers and how it is a mixture of science, creativity, and logic. <em>I never felt more understood in the way I think.</em> 
            
            <li/><span class="bold">Left my business job and went backpacking in Africa.
                
            <br/>
              <li/><span class="bold">Found a job at an engineering firm and put myself back to school</span> </span> Took a <span class="strike">risk</span>, rather, an investment in myself, to put myself back to school and get the skills I needed to become a designer.
            
            <br/><br/>
                
            <li>So here I am - <br/><br/>
            
          <span class="lead">a designer with transferable skills from different corners of my career, <br/>freshly out of UI/UX curriculum  at the University of Denver.</span>
